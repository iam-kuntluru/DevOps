- **Git** is a distriburted version control system that allows deveoper to track changes in thier source code during software development. It helps manage code history, create branches, merge code and work offline without relying on an central server. It's installed and used locally on developers machine.
- On the other hand, **GitHub** is a cloud based platform build on top of Git. It proivdes a web interface to host Git repositories and adds collaboration features like pull request, issues tracking, add code reviews. While **Git** handles version control. **GitHub** enables team collboration and centralized project management.
