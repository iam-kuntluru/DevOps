## ðŸš€ Deployed Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance as part of my DevOps learning journey! 

âœ… Deployed an AWS EC2 instance and installed Ansible
- To Install ansible used below commands
  ```
  sudo apt update  # To update all the packages
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```
âœ… Then created an inventory file to let my machine know where to install the application.
  ```
  [ec2]
  ec2-public-ip ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key.pem ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
  ```
### Explanation of each part
- [ec2] â†’ Group name. You can call it anything ([jenkins_server], [prod], etc.).
- YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP â†’ Replace with your EC2â€™s public IP (e.g., 54.210.123.45).
- ansible_user=ubuntu â†’ The default SSH user for Ubuntu AMIs. For Amazon Linux, itâ€™s usually ec2-user.
- ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/mykey.pem â†’ Path to your .pem key file used for SSH.
- ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 â†’ Tells Ansible to use Python 3 on the remote EC2.

âœ… Written .YAML playbook and executed it on the instance to deploy the Jenkins on cloud. (see Jenkins.yaml playbook for code)
